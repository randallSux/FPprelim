Planning before you work is important in 99% of cases. This is one of them.

Lets plan the structure of the Flamingo Protocol before we implement it. Contact me at randallssux@gmail.com if you have any questions or requests

1)	Data Storage
In this protocol, we will be managing all kinds of data. Right now, we can store them in one of two places, either on-chain, or off-chain within the storage node network. So let's list all data we can think of that needs to be stored, and where it will go, and details about how/why it will be stored that way.

The list below contains abbreviations "ONC" for "on-chain" and "WNN" for "within node network"

Data to be stored:	
ONC - Social Media User Profiles (Profile pictures, bio, etc)
ONC - User Metadata (post history, thread ownership)
WNN - Social Media Posts (raw data of a social media post)
WNN - Social Post MetaData (links to other posts, "likes", "reposts", etc)
WNN - Social Post location data (the location(s) where a post is stored in a storage node, allowing for other nodes to look it up)
ONC - Node activity data (how long a node has been "up for", as well as what it has done on the network) 
ONC - Node identity data (what on-chain account a node is tied to)
ONC - Node Reputation data (only thing I can think of now is history of whether node has passed/failed audits)
WNN - Active Node list (this should go on each node, and should be a list of all active nodes known with thier addresses)
